# Solar Insolation Forecasting Centralized Server

_This is a modified version of the [original](https://github.com/timfurlong/Capstone-Server-Code) repository. The directory structure has been split so that the code bases for the two SIF machines (processing, and server) are seperated._

### Project Overview
* Senior design project that improves upon current short-term cloud forecasting techniques so that solar farms can be used more efficiently.
* Forecasting system involves a network of distributed Android Smartphones, which periodically send cloud photography to a central processing server.
* Development work involved writing image-processing algorithms, creating a web server, database management, and generating Google Earth KML forecasts.
